left going to 0.5 (because v = exp(-t/gamma) => E = exp(-2t/gamma)
No Divergence of timescales and not happening at the trzansition (perhaps like drag shift the resonance peak in an oscillator))

### colliding particles k and mu.py

Both taken non equilibrated with the vibratiion of hte plate because It's clearer like that.
